# **JetRust** - The Fastest Fullstack Rust Framework

Welcome to **JetRust**! This project aims to deliver a high-performance, ultra-lightweight, full-stack web framework, built entirely in **Rust** (except for HTML and CSS). It's designed to provide developers with an efficient, scalable solution for web applications without compromising speed or flexibility.

## **Key Features**

- **100% Rust Backend**: Harness the power and safety of Rust for both backend logic and server-side operations.
- **Optimized Caching**: Built-in caching mechanisms to ensure lightning-fast response times and reduced server load.
- **Custom Tailwind CSS**: A highly optimized, modified version of Tailwind CSS, tailored for this framework, ensuring a sleek design with minimal overhead.
- **Full-Stack Capabilities**: Seamlessly integrate front-end and back-end, all while maintaining a minimalistic approach for maximum performance.
- **Incredible Speed**: Designed from the ground up for speed, **JetRust** will give you one of the fastest experiences in full-stack web development.
- **Incredibly Lightweight**: Every line of code is crafted with performance in mind, making sure your applications stay lean and efficient.

## **Why Rust?**

Rust is the language of choice for this project for its speed, memory safety, and concurrency features. By utilizing Rust, we ensure that your web applications run efficiently, with reduced runtime overhead and an unparalleled level of safety for your code.

## **Getting Started**

To get started with **JetRust**, follow the instructions below to set up your development environment and run your first application:

### **Prerequisites**

- Rust (latest stable version) - [Install Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install)
- Node.js (for frontend build tools) - [Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

### **Installation**

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/project-name.git
   cd project-name
   ```

2. Build and run the server:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   cargo run
   ```

3. Your server will be up and running on `http://localhost:3000`.

### **Customizing Tailwind**

The framework includes a tailored version of **Tailwind CSS** to enhance performance. You can modify the configuration in the `tailwind.config.js` file to suit your design preferences.
